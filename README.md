# Flavour Fusion - AI Recipe Blog Generator

Hey there! 👋  

This is my project **Flavour Fusion** — a fun little web app that uses AI to create full recipe blog posts in just a few seconds.  
You type in any recipe idea (like "Vegan Chocolate Cake" or "Quick Chicken Biryani"), pick how long you want the post to be, and the app generates everything: title, intro, ingredients, steps, tips, serving ideas, storage info... the whole thing.

I built this for my virtual internship and I really enjoyed making it. The best part? While the AI is thinking, it shows a random food joke so you're not just staring at a loading spinner 😄

## Live Demo

## What it does
- Enter a recipe topic  
- Choose word count (500, 800, 1000, 1200, 1500 or 2000 words)  
- Hit "Generate Recipe"  
- See a funny cooking joke while it loads  
- Get a nicely formatted recipe blog post ready to copy-paste or publish

## Technologies I used
- Python  
- Streamlit (super easy for making web apps)  
- Google Gemini API (gemini-1.5-flash) for generating the content  
- Deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud (free & fast)
